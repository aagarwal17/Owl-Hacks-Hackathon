# Owl-Hacks-Hackathon
Some of my work from my team project for the Owl Hacks Coding Competition at Temple University


Over a two-day virtual hackathon, I collaborated with my two teammates in cleaning, visualizing & analyzing data for the Philadelphia Bail Fund and participating in workshops to build professional development. The large data set of nearly 17,000 lines was analyzed using Visual Studio Code and using the pandas library (Python), which helped to build beautiful graphs that helped dissect patterns in the data.
